**Note:** This app is not anywhere near production-grade. It was built as part of my learning journey in React + Cloudflare workers + Typescript.

# Medium Blog App

This is a feature-rich blogging platform inspired by Medium. Users can create and manage blog posts, read content, and engage with other users. The project is built with a modern tech stack and emphasizes scalability, performance, and security.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and sign-in using JWT.
- **Blog Management:** Create, edit, and delete blog posts.

#### Soon to be added features:-

- **Rich Text Editing:** Craft engaging posts with an intuitive editor.
- **Responsive Design:** Seamless experience across devices.
- **User Interaction:** Comment and like posts to engage with the community.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:

- **React**: Component-based UI framework for building interactive interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Enhances code quality and developer productivity.
- **Zod**: Schema-based validation and type inference.

### Backend:

- **Cloudflare Workers**: Serverless environment for scalable backend logic.
- **Prisma**: ORM with connection pooling for efficient database operations.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for structured data storage.

### Common:

- This folder includes the Zod types required in both frontend and backend.
  I have published it as a npm package- [Link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ritesh0605/medium-common)

### Authentication:

- **JWT**: Secure authentication mechanism.
- **Cookies-Based Approach**: Explored for alternative session management.
